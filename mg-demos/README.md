# MiniGUI Demos

This is a set of comprehensive demonstrations of MiniGUI and
its key components, including mGEff, mGPlus, mGNCS, and mGNCS4Touch.

The demos are supplements to [mGUXDemo]. They illustrate the following
features which are not implemented in mGUXDemo:

1. The activity-driven framework derived from mGUXDemo (`common/`).
1. Vairous input methods:
   * Screen locker with digital password.
   * A soft keyboard to input Latin words, digits, and Chinese characters.
1. Using GNU gettext `.mo` files for localization.
1. Interacting with system services by using an asynchronous task thread,
for example:
   * Getting WiFi hotspots list and connecting to a specific WiFi hotspot.
   * Getting system events to updating the icons on status bar.
1. Message screen and toast window.

Currently, there are two demos included in this project.

## CBPlusUI

This demo is a simplified edition of a real product called `CBPlus`.
So it can be a very good start of one application which is based on MiniGUI.

Note that the system services are fake ones in the demo. You may need
to replace them with a real mechanism to interact with the underlying
services. In the real product, we use `ubus` of OpenWRT as the
mechanism to interact with the system services.

## SoftKBD

This demo creates a soft keyboard to input characters with touch panel.

## Prerequisites

  * A C/C++ compiler compatible with C++ 11 (gcc 4.5+ or clang).
  * MiniGUI: v3.2.2 or later
  * MiniGUI Resource: v3.0.12 or later
  * mGPlus: v1.4.0 or later
  * mGEff: v1.2.0 or later
  * mGNCS: V1.2.2 or later
  * mGNCS4Touch: V1.2.2 or later
  * 3rd-party libraries:
    * chipmunk-5.3.1

## Building

If you are using MiniGUI 4.0, we strongly recommend you to build
the demos by using the fetching and building scripts of
`build-minigui-4.0`:

https://github.com/VincenWei/build-minigui-4.0

Or, if you are using MiniGUI 3.2, you can use the following commands
to configure, make, install, and run the demos, once you have installed
the dependent libraries listed above:

    $ ./autogen.sh; # if you got the source from GitHub repo
    $ ./configure;
    $ make

To run a demo:

    $ cd cbplusui
    $ ./cbplusui

## Configure Options

The configure script provides the following options:

    # Whether display tooltip window for soft keyboard:
    --enable-tooltip

    # with or without animation for soft keyboard:
    --enable-animate

    # specify the size of soft keyboard:
    --with-softkbdsize=480x272/320x240/240x320
