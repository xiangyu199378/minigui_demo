This tool is used to translate the variable count args macro of C 
for example: _M, _IM, _SUPER, NEWV
it used to support lower version of gcc or the comipler which doest not support VA_ARGS

use:
    make -- to make tools vaargs_list
    trans.sh -- the script to translate

before use trans.sh, prepare a list of files to be translated:

cat < _ACEOF > list.txt
a.c
b.c
c.c
...
 _ACEOF 

 ./trans.sh list.txt


vaargs_trans whould not translate the code in comment or in string, but if the code is 
bettween in "#if 0" and "#endif", it still translate them. 

To ensure the code is right, can be compiler by the gcc, or I don't known what would be output


You can support the new pattern for this vaargs_trans. 
Open file trans.l, and find the variable "output_pattern", and append your pattern:
    1. first string is the marco name
    2. second string is pattern:
        1) '$' + NUM is the param number, start with '1', for example, the express "_M(pobj, method, arg1)", the $1 indicate "pobj", $2 indicate "method"
        2) '@' + NUM is the param list start with NUM, for example, @3 mean fill the param list from the thrid param to end of param list
    3. end with "{NULL, NULL}"
